# Server-Client Moving Square

This project was developed as part of the 5-unit *System Design and Programming* course in the "Cyber Class" during high school. The project demonstrates communication between client and server within the same network, utilizing fundamental programming and networking concepts.

## Features
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Implements a communication model where the client and server interact over a shared local network.
- **Moving Square Animation**: Displays a dynamic square that serves as a home screen element, moving seamlessly between two or more connected monitors.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Ensures smooth transitions and responsiveness during movement across the screens.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Networking Protocols**: Basic TCP/IP communication.

## Purpose
This project aimed to:
1. Showcase understanding of client-server communication.
2. Develop and implement graphical user interface (GUI) elements.
3. Enhance skills in system integration and debugging within a networked environment.
